### üí° Idea
> Goal is to develop a taskmanager which you can use at any device and in any style you like, whether on terminal, using whatsapp, website or a mobile application. So you can manage all your tasks at one place and in a style which suits you best.

### ü§î How To Start Using??
> Simply create an account, create a new board and start adding tasks to it.

### ‚ú® Current Features
> 1. Responsive Design to support all devices.
> 2. Board feature to devide tasks into different categories.
> 3. Drag & Drop to change task category
> 4. Kanban-style workflow.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Tech Stack Used
> 1. Front End: front end is made using **React(TypeScript)** and **Tailwind**  and **Framer Motion** for animation.
> 2. Back End: back end is REST based using **Django** with **Django Rest Framework Library** and **Postgresql** for database.
> 4. Cloud Service: **Heroku** for backend and **Netlify** for frontend

### üöÄ Running Locally
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
